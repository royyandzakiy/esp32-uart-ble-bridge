# ESP32 - <BLE> - Android

This is a simple project which uses and ESP32 to communicate with another device (not necessarily an Android Phone) through BLE Communication. The way it works is by using BLE as a simulated "UART Bridge", which give similair outputs, but is developed using the BLE standards, such as using server-client and service callbacks.
